        Welcome to trust-fundraising.co.uk and to the home page of Sue Crow, a Trusts and Statutory Fundraising Specialist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sue provides hands-on fundraising support to UK-based charities. She has over 25 years' 
        experience in the fundraising sector with a proven track record of securing funds from 
        trusts and foundations, the Big Lottery (in its many incarnations) and UK government. 
        She relies on careful, in-depth research and well-honed communication skills to give 
        your charity the best possible chance at securing much-needed, and increasingly hard 
        to come by, funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sue offers the following services:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trust and Foundation appeal drafting</li>
        <li>Big Lottery and statutory application drafting</li>
        <li>Bespoke funding research tailored to your charity</li>
        <li>Trust fundraising audits</li>
        <li>Bespoke reports for donors</li>
        <li>Trust fundraising training and workshops</li>
        <li>Advice on UK funding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        She also offers the <strong>E-Coaching Service</strong> which aims not only to develop new successful grant-seekers, 
        but also to bring fresh ideas to more experienced fundraisers. Rather than simply reviewing 
        and correcting applications, the email-based service encourages the fundraiser to approach 
        their applications with a fresh mind, questioning each section of the document, considering 
        the thought processes of the grant-maker and answering their questions before they arise. 
        This new innovative service will improve charities' in-house skills set in the most 
        cost-effective manner and increase their chances of fundraising success.
