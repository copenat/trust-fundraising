    "content": "Recently I worked with another amazing charity called Hope for the Young on a successful Big Lottery application. Hope for the Young makes a real difference to the lives of young refugees and asylum-seekers by providing a one-to-one mentoring service which offers support and advice to young asylum-seekers when they first arrive in the UK on matters ranging from language development and study skills, to emotional support and confidence building. They also provide grants to support young refugees and asylum seekers who have no access to government funds, or to those who are facing extreme financial hardship, to complete their education.\n\nHead of Programmes and Development, Matt Blacker, was over the moon when he found out that the application had been successful because, as he said, 'This is going to cause a step-change in the way Hope for the Young operates. Our team is going to increase, our core infrastructure is going to become stronger ... Most importantly, it means we are going to be able to focus more time and energy on those we are here to support.'\n\nHe went on to say, 'You were instrumental in helping us shape our National Lottery proposal, resulting in this multi-year grant. Your knowledge and expertise shone through any questions we had throughout the process. I learnt a lot in a short space of time with your guidance and you helped ensure the application was the best it could be. You were also there at very short notice to give advice and I really appreciate this. We could not be more grateful for your support.'\n\nThere ends another highly satisfactory week!",

Her guidance has not only helped with applying for grants, but has also assisted in other areas of our work, especially in writing fundraising letters and copy for our website. Sue taught me the art of being succinct, whilst using creative and positive language to get my message across. She is very patient and has a gentle yet direct approach to coaching. I highly recommend Sue, and will continue to use her services myself for any future grant applications.'",

    "content": "Sue has completed over three years with St John Ambulance, the UK's leading provider of first aid training in the UK. When Sue started with St John Ambulance they were going through a period of transition, and she was asked to hold the trust fundraising reins from a short time. Contracted to support trust fundraising for four days a month, trust income shot up by around 500% in her first year. St John Ambulance followed this up with a request for Sue to sign a further 2-year contract.\n\nEarly in 2015 that contract came to an end. St John Ambulance now has a full in-house trust fundraising team and a firm footing from which to continue their trust fundraising activities.\n\nTegan Jones, Head of Fundraising, when asked to comment on Sue's input said, 'Sue has been a tremendous resource to St John Ambulance and has always displayed an excellent understanding of trust fundraising engagement techniques; a clear understanding of the reporting expectations of trust funders and how charities should ensure that proposed projects are structured to ensure impact is accurately measured. Sue has an excellent understanding of the UK trust landscape and expert knowledge of particular funding bodies. I would have no hesitation in utilising her services in the future.'",

    "content": "To mark the beginning of a new and for many, austere, financial year trust-fundraising.co.uk has launched the e-coaching service for trust, foundation and statutory fundraisers.\n\nThe objectives of the service, which has been developed over a six-month pilot, are to cultivate and improve in-house talent. E-coaching aims not only to develop new successful grant-seekers, but also to bring fresh ideas to more experienced fundraisers.\n\nRather than simply reviewing and correcting applications, the email-based service run by Director, Sue Crow, encourages the fundraiser to consider for themselves why certain elements of their application may not be successful with the grant-maker.\n\nSue assists the fundraiser to approach the application with a fresh mind, questioning each section of the document, considering the thought processes of the grant-maker and answering their questions before they arise. This new innovative service will improve charities' in-house skills set whilst also increasing their chances of fundraising success.\n\nSport4Life was one of the first charities to sign up to the e-coaching pilot. With support from trust-fundraising.co.uk the charity developed a successful application to The Big Lottery, securing a grant of £289,768.\n\nSport4Life Manager James Forrest said: 'The e-coaching from Sue has been exceptionally beneficial to our small charity. It has helped to raise the skill set and knowledge of those responsible for fundraising, and in turn enabled us to achieve excellent successes with recent grant and trust bids.'",
