        <p>"Sue has provided our Development Team with invaluable help and support towards our Trust and Foundation programme to support both our revenue activities and our successful £9.8 million capital campaign, Mercury Rising. We really couldn't have done it without her. She's provided a wealth of detailed knowledge, provided coaching and support for staff and guided us – myself and the team – through the whole process. We can't recommend Sue highly enough."</p>

        <p>"Sue worked with Phoenix Futures' at regular intervals for over 10 years. During this time all necessary monies to cover Phoenix Futures' Recovery through Nature programme were successfully raised. Sue was an absolute please to work with – being highly professional, adaptable, committed and conscientious. I cannot recommend her services too highly, and we will most certainly return to using her services if the necessity arises."</p>

        <p>"I met Sue for the first time in 2013 and employed her in a freelance capacity a few weeks later to provide our charity with trust research and new funding applications. Sue proved to be a hardworking and highly organised colleague, with good communication skills that she then utilised to produce much needed successful funding applications. I highly recommend Sue and am sure that she will provide you with the same level of expertise that she afforded us."</p>

        <p>"Sue has been a fantastic resource for Weston Hospicecare, helping us to raise over £600,000 towards both capital and revenue costs over 21 days of work. She has quickly been able to understand the aims, objectives and services our organisation provides and to work with us to turn this into a series of hard-working and effective funding applications resulting in a much needed income boost. I would recommend Sue's services to both organisations with a track record of trust and grant fundraising, and those who need an expert to help them establish a new funding stream."</p>

        <p>"Sue took on a fundraising project for us, that as a small organisation with only one paid member of staff we were unable to carry out ourselves. We had previously taken on another fundraising consultant who had not fulfilled any of the promised work and generated no funding at all. It is always a difficult choice for small charities with little income to decide to use a fundraising consultant as it may be something they have simply not considered before. Throughout the process Sue was a pleasure to work with and I am pleased to report that her successful bids have contributed to the best financial year in the projects history. I have already recommended Sue to others in my network and will certainly take her on for any future work."</p>
