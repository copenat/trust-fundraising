        <p>"Sue has been a fantastic resource for Weston Hospicecare, helping us to raise over Â£600,000 towards both capital and revenue costs over 21 days of work. She has quickly been able to understand the aims, objectives and services our organisation provides and to work with us to turn this into a series of hard-working and effective funding applications resulting in a much needed income boost."</p>

        <p>"The e-coaching from Sue has been exceptionally beneficial to our small charity. It has helped to raise the skill set and knowledge of those responsible for fundraising, and in turn enabled us to achieve excellent successes with recent grant and trust bids."</p>

        <p>"Sue took on a fundraising project for us, that as a small organisation with only one paid member of staff we were unable to carry out ourselves. Throughout the process Sue was a pleasure to work with and I am pleased to report that her successful bids have contributed to the best financial year in the projects history."</p>
